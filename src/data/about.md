# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1995 when I was 3.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk. It took years for me to send my first email.

- At 6, I started doing gymnastics, and my favorite toy was Lego blocks. I used to build catapults.

- At 8, I started building complex structures with parts of electric cars, wood, or metal. I liked to put pieces in different places than they were supposed to be to see what happens.

- At 10, I went scuba diving and dived with a giant sea turtle.

- I was 11 when I got a chicken and two geese as pets.

- When I was 12, my dad built me a go-kart.

- At 13, I quit gymnastics and started swimming. They invited me to join the competition team, and I was there for one year.

- At 14, I started playing squash and one day I almost fainted.

- I was 15 when I started doing circus acrobatics.

- At 16, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter-Strike Source and Age of Empires.

- At 18, I became a circus acrobatics teacher and used to manage three groups.

- At 20, I moved to Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, and I have been living there since then.
